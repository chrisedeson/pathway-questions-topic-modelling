### Advanced Analytics

- Most frequently asked questions (FAQ candidates)
- Response quality metrics and improvement recommendations
- Peak activity times for resource allocation

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Allocation**: Use peak activity insights to schedule support staff
2. **Content Strategy**: Create FAQs from repeat questions
3. **Localization**: Address regions with high unhelpful response rates
4. **Trend Monitoring**: Track weekly trends to identify emerging concerns
5. **Quality Improvement**: Monitor sentiment and feedback metrics

## Troubleshooting

- **No data**: Check AWS credentials and S3 bucket name in `.env` file
- **Slow performance**: Increase `CACHE_TTL` in config.py or refresh data
- **Missing columns**: Verify parquet files from notebook contain all expected fields
- **Visualization errors**: Ensure data has required columns (timestamp, country, etc.)

## Development Notes

- All visualizations are in `utils/visualizations.py`
- Data loading and caching in `utils/data_loader.py`
- Page-specific logic in `pages/` directory
- Theme styling in `config.py` (supports dark/light modes)
