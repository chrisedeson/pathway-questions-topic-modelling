        "# Hybrid Topic Discovery and Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements a hybrid approach that combines similarity-based classification with clustering-based topic discovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Workflow:**\n",
        "1. Load existing topic-questions.csv (Elder Edwards' curated topics) and new student questions\n",
        "2. **Similarity Filtering**: For each new question, find best match using cosine similarity\n",
        "   - If similarity ≥ threshold: Save to File 1 and remove from processing\n",
        "   - If similarity < threshold: Keep for clustering\n",
        "3. **Topic Discovery**: Run clustering pipeline on remaining questions\n",
        "   - Generate embeddings → Reduce dimensions → Cluster → Generate topics\n",
        "4. **Output Generation**: Generate two files for Elder Edwards' review\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "- Configurable similarity threshold and processing modes\n",
        "- Advanced caching system for embeddings\n",
        "- GPT-5 nano/mini integration for topic naming\n",
        "- Comprehensive error handling and progress tracking\n",
        "- Production-ready logging and monitoring\n",
